Some misc code-gen play
Here's some dialogue between me and an agent with data of all the things we made together, and it's reflection on what this project was about (Sep 2023):
Q: What's your sentiment towards the auto recursion code project that was made by an assistant and Quaid?
A: The sentiment towards the auto recursion code project, a collaborative effort between an assistant and Quaid, reflects a blend of technical experimentation and innovation. This project appears to be a deep dive into utilizing recursive techniques alongside Python programming to achieve complex tasks, such as API calls and code execution. This initiative demonstrates an exploratory approach to software development, harnessing the capabilities of Python and recursive functions to potentially streamline or enhance computational tasks.

The documents reveal a focus on modularizing code, making API calls, executing Python code dynamically, and interacting with OpenAI's API in a flexible manner. This involves creating a system that can execute Python code, capture its output, and potentially use it for further processing or decision-making. There's also an emphasis on debugging and dynamic memory, indicating a sophisticated level of programming aimed at creating a robust and flexible system.

Moreover, the project includes iterative development practices, such as capturing executable code from API responses and writing it to dynamic memory for future use. This recursive approach to API interaction and code execution suggests an ambition to automate or enhance certain aspects of programming tasks, possibly making the development process more efficient or opening up new possibilities for code generation and execution.

Given these insights, the sentiment towards this project is positive, reflecting an innovative and exploratory approach to leveraging Python and recursion in software development. The project showcases a commitment to pushing the boundaries of conventional programming practices to explore new solutions or improve existing methodologies.


**The goal here was to explore and create a dynamic memory. Moreover, to leverage what wasn't available at the time which was code generation and running capacities in chat to make a sort of auto-gpt.
